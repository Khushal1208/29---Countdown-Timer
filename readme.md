### **🌟 Day 29: Countdown Timer | #30Days30Projects**  

Today, I built a **fully functional countdown timer** ⏳ that lets users start a timer with preset buttons or a custom input! 🎯 Whether it’s a **quick break, focused work session, or meal time**, this timer helps manage time effectively.  

### 🔹 **Key Features:**  
✔️ **Preset time buttons** (20s, 5m, 15m, etc.) for quick access ⏰  
✔️ **Custom timer input** for flexibility ⌨️  
✔️ **Live countdown display** in both UI & browser title 🖥️  
✔️ **Displays expected end time** to plan ahead 🕒  

### 🔍 **Key Learnings:**  
✅ **Using `setInterval()` & `clearInterval()`** for real-time updates 🎯  
✅ **Handling timestamps with `Date.now()`** for accurate timing ⏱️  
✅ **Dynamically updating the document title** for user convenience 📌  
✅ **Event listeners for buttons & form submission** for seamless interaction 🚀
